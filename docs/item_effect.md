**Description of the fields**

### ID

This is the unique ID for the item\_effect table and has no relation whatsoever to the item ID that is being hotfixed.
This value links to [hotfix\_data.RecordID](hotfix_data#hotfix_data-hotfix_data-RecordID) with the proper TableHash accompanied.

### ItemID

This is the unique ID for the item that has received a hotfix.
This value links to [hotfix\_data.RecordID](hotfix_data_2130074.html#hotfix_data-hotfix_data-hotfix_data-RecordID) with the proper TableHash accompanied, [item.ID](hotfixes_item_2130073.html#hotfixes_item-hotfixes_item-ID) and [item\_sparse.ID](item_sparse#item_sparse-ID).

### OrderIndex

The order in which the spells are displayed on the item tooltip and are placed upon the item. Starts at 0.

### SpellID

The spell ID of the spell that the item can cast or trigger.

### Trigger

The type of trigger for the spell.

| ID | Trigger Type      |
|----|-------------------|
| 0  | Use               |
| 1  | On Equip          |
| 2  | Chance on Hit     |
| 4  | Soulstone         |
| 5  | Use with no delay |
| 6  | Learn Spell ID    |

### Charges

The number of times that the item can cast the spell:

-   If 0, then infinite charges are possible.
-   If negative, after the number of charges is depleted the item is deleted as well.
-   If positive, the item is not deleted after all the charges are spent.

### Cooldown

The cooldown in milliseconds for the specific spell controlling how often the spell can be used.
Use -1 to use the default spell cooldown.

Note: this is not the "internal cooldown" of procs commonly found on items such as trinkets with "Chance on hit" effects.

### Category

The category that the spell is in.

### CategoryCooldown

The cooldown time in milliseconds that is applied to all other spells in the category that the triggered spell is also in.
Use -1 to use the default spell cooldown.

### VerifiedBuild

This field was used to determine whether a template has been verified from WDB files.

If value is 0 then it has not been parsed yet.

If value is above 0 then it has been parsed with WDB files from that specific client build.

If value is -1 then it is just a place holder until proper data are found on WDBs.
