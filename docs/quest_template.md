**Description of the fields**

### ID

The quest ID. This column is the Primary Key for the Table. Each quest ID must be unique!

### QuestType

Accepted values: 0, 1, 2 or 3. Their meaning is described in table below.

| Value | Result                                                                                                   |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Quest is enabled, but it is auto-completed when accepted; this skips quest objectives and quest details. |
| 1     | Quest is disabled (not yet implemented in the core).                                                     |
| 2     | Quest is enabled (does not auto-complete).                                                               |
| 3     | Quest is a World Quest.                                                                                  |

### QuestLevel

Level of quest. Player receives full experience amount only if their level is less than or equal to Level+5. If Level is set to -1, the player's level will be used as (Quest)Level for the experience calculation.

### MinLevel

Minimum level at which a player can get the quest.

### QuestSortID

This field defines under what category the quest falls in the quest log.

If **value &gt; 0** then value is Zone IDs taken from AreaTable.dbc.

if **value &lt; 0** then (**-value**) is quest sort id: (in general profession or class quests. Also see [RequiredSkillPoints](#quest_template-RequiredSkillPoints) ) Value is ID from QuestSort.dbc

### QuestInfoID

These values are ID taken from [QuestInfo.dbc](QuestInfo)

### SuggestedGroupNum

Recommended number of players to do the quest together.

### RequiredFactionId1

Faction ID 1 for an objective to achieve a certain reputation value with. See Faction.dbc

### RequiredFactionId2

Faction ID 2 for an objective to achieve a certain reputation value with. See Faction.dbc

### RequiredFactionValue1

Reputation value 1 that the player must achieve with the faction in [RepObjectiveFaction](#quest_template-RepObjectiveFaction) as part of the quest objectives.

### RequiredFactionValue2

Reputation value 2 that the player must achieve with the faction in [RepObjectiveFaction](#quest_template-RepObjectiveFaction) as part of the quest objectives.

### RewardNextQuest

** RewardNextQuest (Old field name: NextQuestIdChain)**

The quest entry from a **creature** or **gameobject** that ends a quest and starts a new one. The result is, that if you end the quest, the new quest instantly appears from the quest giver.

See the [examples section](#quest_template-Examples) for examples.

### RewardXPDifficulty

According to the [Level](#quest_template-Level), the basic experience with index *RewardXPDifficulty* is taken from QuestXP.dbc.

This field also controls the XP given as the XP is calculated from the value in this field by the following formula. If the quest is repeatable, XP will be given only once. The total XP that a character will receive is also affected by the level difference between the character's level and the quest's level.

The formula for calculating XP from the value in this field:
- **QuestLevel &gt;= 65:** XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 6.0
- **QuestLevel h1. 64:** XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 4.8
- **QuestLevel 63:** XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 3.6
- **QuestLevel h1. 62:** XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 2.4
- **QuestLevel 61:** XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 1.2
- **QuestLevel &lt;= 60:** XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 0.6

### RewardMoney

Money earned by completing the quest (if value &gt; 0) or money requirement to complete the quest (if value &lt; 0) .

### RewardBonusMoney

The money a character at level 80 would get when they complete this quest.

### RewardDisplaySpell

Spell that is shown to be casted on quest completion in the quest log. Note that this spell will NOT be casted if [RewardSpell](#quest_template-RewardSpell) is non-zero. The spell in the other field will be casted instead, in which case the spell here only serves as the visual in the quest log.

### RewardSpell

Spell that is shown to be casted on quest completion in the quest log. Note that this spell will NOT be casted if [RewardSpellCast](quest_template#rewardspellcast) is non-zero. The spell in the other field will be casted instead, in which case the spell here only serves as the visual in the quest log.

NOTE: This field comes straight from the WDB and should not be changed.

### RewardHonor

Number of honorable kill honor rewarded for completing this quest.

Example: An example value is 15 for quest 8388: At level 80 an honorable kill is 124 honor worth. Multiply this with 15 and you receive 1860, after the multiplication the value is rounded up. So the honor rewarded at level 80 is 1860 for this quest.

### RewardKillHonor


### StartItem

Items given by the quest giver at beginning of the quest. Items will be deleted when quest is abandoned.

### Flags

This flag field defines more specifically the type of quest it is. Aside from the daily flag and sharable flag, this field is used just for grouping purposes and NOT for any other quest requirements. The quest requirements are calculated from non-zero values in other quest template fields. Also, while some of these flags are known, others have yet an unknown purpose and the comments below is simply guesswork on them.
