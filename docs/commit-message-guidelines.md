# ✍️ Co-Author(s)
If there are more authors, they can be mentioned like this:
```

Co-authored-by: Name [name@example.com](mailto:name@example.com)

```

**If you are cherry-picking commits, it is mandatory to refer the original author in your commit.**

When you create a commit (using the GIT Bash terminal), type:

``` 
git commit --author="John Doe <john@example.com>" -m "Your commit message"
```

✔️ This sets the Author field in the commit to John Doe <john@example.com>
✔️ Your normal Git config user.name and user.email will still be used for the Committer field.

If you are using GitHub Desktop, you may fill the co-author field, underneath the commit description box.

# 📦 Scope and 🔧 Subscope
Scope defines the main area affected:

- Core (core related, framework files)
- Scripts (core related, script files)
- DB (database related, SQL)

Follow the file names or content type:

- fix(Scripts/Ulduar): Mimiron rocket barrage targeting

- fix(DB/SAI): Add missing spells to Howling Prowler

👉 For SQL commits:
If the content is mixed, choose the most predominant table type.
Example: if most edits are in smart_scripts, use SAI.
If the changes are too diluted, use a general sub-scope like Misc.

For example:
```
fix(Scripts/Ulduar): Mimiron rocket barrage targeting
```

Or

```
fix(DB/SAI): Add missing spells to Howling Prowler
```
