# Clang-Format

This is a formatter that will automatically format any C/C++ based files defined in the [.clang-format](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/blob/master/.clang-format) file.

Some IDE's like Visual Studio can detect this file and will start formatting the code as you write it.
