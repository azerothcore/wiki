**Description of the fields**

### Entry

This is just a automatic counter that assigns a value to each trigger to list it.

### Map

This field recall a certain map based on the ID (for example, ID 30 recalls Elwynn Forest)

### X, Y and Z

Contains the coordinates of the three 3d dimensions.

### Radius

This contains the radius of activation of the trigger.

### Length, Width, Height and Orientation

these fields contain the values for the physics and behavior of a given trigger.
