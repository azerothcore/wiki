1. First make sure that your core is [up-to-date](keeping-the-server-up-to-date.md).

## Automatic Database Updater

By default the Worldserver and Authserver will check for, and import all new files into the database you specified in the config.

1. Start worldserver.exe

To edit the automatic database updater you will find the neccessary settings in authserver.conf and worldserver.conf under [UPDATE SETTINGS](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/commit/2d2857ce81db5297eb63d388d2e2f252ef52412d#diff-56b141374cf0384a2887c9fd490c6a79a3d2f31fb020ee0e423a5685344b59d3R30).
