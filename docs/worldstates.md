# worldstates

[<-Back-to:Characters](database-characters.md)

**The \`worldstates\` table**

This table holds data the Core needs to handle variables (like timer for arena point automatic flush).

**Structure**

| Field   | Type          | Attributes | Key | Null | Default | Extra | Comment |

### entry

Hardcoded entry related to variables needed to be saved by the Core.
For example \`entry\` = 20001 is for the timer to flush arena points. More examples below.

### value

Value generated by the core regarding the entry.

### comment

Comment in text format so it is easier to see what the entry is for.
