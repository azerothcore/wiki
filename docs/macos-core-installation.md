## Required software

See [Requirements](requirements.md) before you continue.

## Getting the source code

Choose **ONE** of the following method, run one of the below `git ...` commands in your terminal.


1. Clone only the master branch + full history (smaller size - recommended):

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk.git --branch master --single-branch azerothcore
    ```

1. Clone only the master branch + no previous history (smallest size):

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk.git --branch master --single-branch azerothcore --depth 1
    ```

    Note: If you want to get the full history back, use `git fetch --unshallow`.

1. Clone all branches and all history:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk.git azerothcore
    ```

This will create an `azerothcore-wotlk` directory containing the AC source files.

## Compiling the source code

### Creating the build-directory

To avoid issues with updates and colliding source builds, we create a specific build-directory, so we avoid any possible issues due to that (if any might occur)

```sh
cd azerothcore
mkdir build
cd build
```

### Configuring for compiling

Before running the CMake command, replace `$HOME/azeroth-server/` with the path of the server installation (where you want to place the compiled binaries).

Parameter explanation for advanced users [CMake options](cmake-options.md).

At this point, you must be in your "build/" directory.

**Note**: in the follows command the variable `$HOME` is the path of the **current user**, so if you are logged as root, $HOME will be "/root".

```sh
export OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)
cmake ../ \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/azeroth-server/  \
-DTOOLS_BUILD=all \
-DSCRIPTS=static \
-DMYSQL_ADD_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include \
-DMYSQL_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/libmysqlclient.dylib \
-DREADLINE_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/opt/readline/include \
-DREADLINE_LIBRARY=/usr/local/opt/readline/lib/libreadline.dylib \
-DOPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR="$OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR/include" \
-DOPENSSL_SSL_LIBRARIES="$OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR/lib/libssl.dylib" \
-DOPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARIES="$OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR/lib/libcrypto.dylib"
```

To know the amount of cores available.
You can use the following command

```sh
nproc --all
```

Then, replacing `4` with the number of threads that you want to execute, type:

```sh
make -j 4
make install
```
