### basehp2

Base health for the creature if creature\_template.exp value is set to 2. This value is multiplied by [creature\_template.Health\_mod](creature_template#health_mod)  to determine the creature's final health.

### basemana

Base mana for the creature. This value is multiplied by  [creature\_template.Mana\_mod](creature_template#mana_mod) to determine the creature's final mana.

### damage\_exp1

Modifier used to calculate the damage output of a creature. This field is used if a creature's [exp](creature_template#exp) is set to 1. See [DamageModifier](creature_template#damagemodifier) for more information.
