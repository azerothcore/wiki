**Description of the fields**

| 2  | Warsong Gulch          |
| 3  | Arathi Basin           |

### MinPlayersPerTeam

Controls the minimum number of players that need to join the battleground on each faction side for the battleground to start. For the battleground to start, all characters (between min and max player values) must be in the same tier. Tiers are set up in ranges of 10 levels except for level 80. So the first tier is 10-19, the next are 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79 and finally 80. If characters of different tiers all join the queue, they will join their respective tier's queue and wait for more players of their tier to join the queue. Characters in different tiers can never join the same battleground.

### MaxPlayersPerTeam

Controls how many players from each team can join the battleground.

NOTE2: If left to be 0, trinity will use the default DBC value.

### MinLvl

The minimum level that players need to be in order to join the battleground.

NOTE: If left to be 0, trinity will use the default DBC value.

### MaxLvl

The maximum level that players can be to enter the battleground.

NOTE: If left to be 0, trinity will use the default DBC value.

### AllianceStartLoc

The location where the alliance players get teleported to when the battleground first starts. See WorldSafeLocs.dbc

### AllianceStartO
