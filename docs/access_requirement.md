**Description of the fields**

### mapId

This is the [access\_id](instance_template) field from the [instance\_template](instance_template) table. It is an arbitrary number that merely links the requirements to an [instance\_template](instance_template), or [areatrigger\_teleport](areatrigger_teleport)

### difficulty

- 5 man dungeons - 0 for normal, 1 for heroic, 2 for epic (not used yet)
- 10 man dungeons - 0 for normal, 2 for heroic
- 25 man dungeons - 1 for normal, 3 for heroic

### level\_min

The minimum level that you must be in order to enter the instance.

### level\_max

The maximum level that you can be in order to enter the instance.

### item\_level

The at least required item level for an instance.

-   All WotLK Heroics require at least an average item level of 180.
-   Trial of the Champion, Pit of Saron, and the Forge of Souls require an average item level of 200.
-   Halls of Reflection requires an average item level of 219.

**Note:** this requirement only applies to the Dungeon Finder and the Raid Browser, not to a dungeon/raid portal (and it's blizzlike). This also means a guild could try to clear a raid while being undergeared :)

### item

A horde only [item](item_template) that you must have in your inventory to enter the instance. This item can not be in the bank.

### item2

An alliance only [item](item_template) that you must have in your inventory. This item can not be in the bank.

### quest\_done\_A

A [quest](quest_template) that you must have completed. This field is only for alliance.

### quest\_done\_H

A [quest](quest_template) that you must have completed. This field is only for horde.

### completed\_achievement

An [achievement](Achievement) that must be completed by the player to enter an instance.

### quest\_failed\_text

The text that is shown if you try and enter the instance without having completed the quest.

### comment

This field is for any comment you want to make about the requirements or the instance. It is arbitrary text.
