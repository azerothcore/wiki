- Open the realmlist.wtf file inside your World of **Warcraft\Data** folder. The IP in the realmlist.wtf file should be exactly the same as the IP address you entered in the realmlist table previously.

    - Change the first line to: set realmlist <IP address used in realmlist table>
    
    - Example: set realmlist 127.0.0.1

- (Optional) If you wish to use the WoW Launcher.exe to run your client then you must change your set patchlist to the same ip/dns name as your realmlist.

**NOTE don't use localhost for address, if you need to connect to localhost use 127.0.0.1**
