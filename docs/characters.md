### equipmentCache

### ammoId

[Template ID](http://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/item_template#entry) of the ammo item


### knownTitles

Contains data about known Titles stored in 6 x 16bit integers. To calculate where a knownTitle is in one of those 6 integers you do the following: We select one of the titles from [CharTitles.dbc](CharTitles), take Archmage title for example:

| TitleID | UnkRef? | MaleTitle   | FemaleTitle | InGameOrder |
|---------|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 93      | 0       | Archmage %s | Archmage %s | 61          |


We use the InGameOrder to calculate in which one of the 6 (16bit) integer is the title stored:

```
InGameOrder / 32 = X
61 / 32 = **1,90625** (1 - Do **NOT** round the value!)
```

so the 1st integer stores the title. Because counting starts from **0** to 5, it would be "0 **TITLE_BIT** 0 0 0 0".

Now which bit stores the title? We use modulo to calculate this.

```
InGameOrder Modulo 32 = X
61 Mod 32 = **29**
```

so the 29bit stores the title. This would be 2 ^ 29 = 536870912. This bit stores the Archmage title. This would mean if you **only** have the Archmage title, characters.knownTitles would be "0 536870912 0 0 0 0".


### actionBars

A bitmask that contains visible actionbars for the player
