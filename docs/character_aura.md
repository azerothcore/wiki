# character\_aura

[<-Back-to:Characters](database-characters.md)

**The \`character\_aura\` table**

Contains aura information that is loaded when a character is loaded, so the auras that were on the character when it logged out are still kept when it logs back in. A spell can have up to three auras, one in each of its effects.
