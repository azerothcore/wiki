**Relation to [\`player\_race\_stats\`](player_race_stats)**

This table alone does not define the stats of a character at any level. The values from this table are combined with the values found in the `player\_race\_stats` table to apply the final stats to a character at any level.

The way the final stat can be calculated is as follows: Take the base stat from this table and add the modifier for that stat from `player\_race\_stats`.

For example, a druid at level forty has a base strength stat of forty-six. Combining that with a night elf's strength modifier of negative four, you get a final value of forty-two.
