**The \`autobroadcast\` table**

This table contains the autobroadcast entries for your realms. Values like it's activity, position and Timer (\*.On, \*.Center, \*.Timer) are defined within the [worldserver.conf](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/blob/master/src/server/worldserver/worldserver.conf.dist). They are chosen randomly, based on their weight.

**Description of the fields**

### realmid

The [realmlist.id](realmlist). Defines which realm this entry belongs to. Use **-1** for all realms to load this entry.

### id

Unique identifier key per realm. Entries with same id will override each other without warnings - this can be used to replace -1 realmidÂ entry on a specific realm.

### weight

A non-negative integer. Entries with higher weight have more chance to get picked.

### text

The text to broadcast. Color and item/spell/quest link formating codes can be used.
