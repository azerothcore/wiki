# broadcast\_text

**The \`broadcast\_text\` table**

 

This table (ref <https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/commit/60e87db>) will have **everything** you need for your scripts' texts, such as: [gossips](gossip_menu_option), [creature texts](creature_text) and [npc\_text](npc_text)s.

Its purpose is (will be) used as a globalized table containing the texts as mentionned above, and things like their sounds, their emotes and the languages in which the texts should be said.

 

All the values are from sniffs (ADBVerified) so, don't add things in it - Kinzcool.

### Type

 

#### WDBVerified

This field was used to determine whether a template has been verified from WDB files (ADB files for this one).

If value is 0 then it has not been parsed yet.

If value is above 0 then it has been parsed with WDB files from that specific client build.

If value is -1 then it is just a place holder until proper data are found on WDBs.

If value is -Client Build then it was parsed with WDB files from that specific [client build](http://archive.trinitycore.info/DB:Auth:realmlist#gamebuild "DB:Auth:realmlist") and manually edited later for some special necessity.
