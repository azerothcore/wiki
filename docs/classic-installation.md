| [<< Start: Installation](installation) | [Step 1: Requirements >>](requirements) |

Every step of the guide is divided in three tabs regarding different operating systems (Linux, macOS and Windows).

The guide has been divided into 8 steps, to make it more readable:

1. [Requirements](requirements)

2. [Core Installation](core-installation)

3. [Server Setup](server-setup)

4. [Database Installation](database-installation)

5. [Networking](networking)

6. [Final Server Steps](final-server-steps)

7. [Keeping the Server Up-to-Date](keeping-the-server-up-to-date)

8. [Client Setup](client-setup)

Each step can be read independently or you can read them neatly in order, to gradually get into it and better understand it all.
