#### WDBVerified

This field is used by the AzerothCore Team to determine whether a template has been verified from WDB files (ADB files for this one).

If value is 0 then it has not been parsed yet.

If value is above 0 then it has been parsed with WDB files from that specific client build.

If value is -1 then it is just a place holder until proper data are found on WDBs.

If value is [-Client Build](https://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/realmlist "DB:Auth:realmlist") then it was parsed with WDB files from that specific [client build](https://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/realmlist#gamebuild "DB:Auth:realmlist") and manually edited later for some special necessity.
