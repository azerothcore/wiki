## Generic MySQL clients

We recommend to use a generic client to access and manage your MySQL/MariaDB databases.

With a MySQL client you can easily create/view/edit/delete your database/tables and their contents.

Here's a list of free and open source clients (feel free to edit this page to suggest your favourite):

- [HeidiSQL](http://www.heidisql.com) - works on Windows as well as on Linux using [wine](https://www.winehq.org/)
- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) - cross-platform
- [SequelAce](https://sequel-ace.com/) - for macOS, you can install it with `brew cask install sequel-ace`
- [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) - web app written in PHP (cross-platform)


## Official AzerothCore DB Editor: Keira3

[Keira3](https://www.azerothcore.org/Keira3) is the official Database Editor of AzerothCore.

It allows you to view and edit your world DB contents by automatically generating the SQL code that you need.

Note that Keira3 is **not** meant to be used as a generic MySQL client, 
so we recommend to download Keira3 **and** one of the MySQL clients listed above. They serve different purposes.
