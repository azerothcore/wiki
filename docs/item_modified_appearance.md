**Description of the fields**

### ID

This is the unique ID for the item\_modified\_appearance table and has no relation whatsoever to the item ID that is being hotfixed.
This value links to [hotfix\_data.RecordID](hotfix_data#hotfix_data-hotfix_data-RecordID) with the proper TableHash accompanied.

### ItemID

This is the unique ID for the item that has received a hotfix.
This value links to [hotfix\_data.RecordID](hotfix_data_2130074.html#hotfix_data-hotfix_data-hotfix_data-RecordID) with the proper TableHash accompanied, [item.ID](hotfixes_item_2130073.html#hotfixes_item-hotfixes_item-ID) and [item\_sparse.ID](item_sparse#item_sparse-ID).

### AppearanceModID

This value is obtained from ItemBonus.db2 and acts as a selector when there are multiple entries for the same item ID.This value is by default set to 0.

### AppearanceID

This value links to item\_appearance.ID and basically creates the link between the specified Item ID and the Appearance tables accompanying it.

### IconFileDataID

This value is unused, leave it at 0.

### Index

This value is unused, leave it at 0.

### VerifiedBuild

This field was used to determine whether a template has been verified from WDB files.

If value is 0 then it has not been parsed yet.

If value is above 0 then it has been parsed with WDB files from that specific client build.

If value is -1 then it is just a place holder until proper data are found on WDBs.
