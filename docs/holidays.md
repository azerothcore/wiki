## eventSchedulerType
```
eventSchedulerType defines what kind of timer is used for when the event is to stop, start etc. - and if it uses different stages during it's "buildup"-phase (2 stages available)
-1: event repeats every year based on column11, column12 etc dates - length and possible event stages is taken from the information given in column1 and column2 (adjusted in DBC to keep it in line with **yearly** changes) - if column12=0, use DATE only from field11
0: event repeats every 7 days, with a duration of <eventStage1Duration> hours (hardcoded startdate serverside depending on eventID)
1: event repeats based on column11, column12 etc values (see -1) - if <eventStage2Duration> exists, use <eventStage1Duration> as event prestage length
2: event repeats every X hours (with <eventStage2Duration> being the eventPause/eventWait timer)
```
