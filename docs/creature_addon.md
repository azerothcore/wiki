**The \`creature\_addon\` table**

The creature\_addon and creature\_template\_addon tables define different things that are applied on creatures when they are loaded. These "different things" can be for example to have the creature be mounted, to have it emote something, to have it display an aura effect, etc. Through the use of the fields in this table, many things can be changed about the outward visual appearance of the creature. The creature\_template\_addon table affects all creatures with that creature template ID while the creature\_addon table affects individually spawned creatures (so that two creatures using the same template can look different).

NOTE: A creature\_addon record will override a creature\_template\_addon record should they overlap on the same creature.

NOTICE: The data for this table is largely incomplete and is mostly just a regurgitation of what the client receives from the server. This article is a WIP as to what all the possible values are.

0 = Normal,Â standard visible distance from worldserver.conf (default 90 yards)

1 = Large, maximum visibility distance (250 yards)

### auras

This field controls any auras to be applied on the creature (both in effect and visually). To apply multiple auras, you can add more aura entries, separating each entry by a space. Remember that if a spell applies multiple auras.

List of useful aura entries (examples):

- '18950' - Makes the creature detect other invisible units (players or creatures).
- '16380 18950' - Both auras above
