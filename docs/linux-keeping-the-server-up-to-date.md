## Keeping the source Up-to-Date

```sh
cd ~/azerothcore/
git pull origin master
```

```sh
cd build
make -j 8; make install
```

Sometimes we add or remove files from the repositiory. At that point it is neccessary to recompile the server, the same way as it was installed the first time [in the Linux Core Installation](linux-core-installation.md#configuring-for-compiling).

## Keeping the Database Up-to-Date
