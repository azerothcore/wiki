| :- | :- |
| This article is a part of the Installation Guide. You can read it alone or click on the previous link to easily move between the steps. |
| [<< Start: Installation](installation.md) | [Step 1: Requirements >>](requirements.md) |

Every step of the guide is divided in three tabs regarding different operating systems (Linux, macOS and Windows).

The guide has been divided into 8 steps, to make it more readable:

1. [Requirements](requirements.md)

2. [Core Installation](core-installation.md)

3. [Server Setup](server-setup.md)

4. [Database Installation](database-installation.md)

5. [Networking](networking.md)

6. [Final Server Steps](final-server-steps.md)

7. [Keeping the Server Up-to-Date](keeping-the-server-up-to-date.md)

8. [Client Setup](client-setup.md)

Each step can be read independently or you can read them neatly in order, to gradually get into it and better understand it all.
