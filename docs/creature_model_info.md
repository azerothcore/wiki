**The \`creature\_model\_info\` table**

This table contains all models of mobs, their gender and other information that are model related. This means that when a creature uses another model, this information will change as well.

**Description of the fields**

This field is unused. It's purpose is currently unknown. It may or may not be linked to path-finding.

| ----- | ----------- |
| 0     | Male        |
| 1     | Female      |
