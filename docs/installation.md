## Azerothcore Classic setup

Every step of the guide is divided in three tabs regarding different operating systems (Linux, macOS and Windows).

The guide has been divided into 8 steps, to make it more readable:

1. [Requirements](requirements.md)

1. [Core Installation](core-installation.md)

1. [Server Setup](server-setup.md)

1. [Database Installation](database-installation.md)

1. [Networking](networking.md)

1. [Final Server Steps](final-server-steps.md)

1. [Keeping the Server Up-to-Date](keeping-the-server-up-to-date.md)

1. [Client Setup](client-setup.md)

Each step can be read independently or you can read them neatly, to gradually get into it and better understand it all.

*Tip: If this is your first time installing AzerothCore we recommend that you read every step carefully!*
