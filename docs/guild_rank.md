**Description of the fields**

### guildid

The guild ID that the rank is part of. See guild.guildid

### rid

The particular rank ID. This number must be unique to each rank in a guild.

### rname

The name of the rank that is displayed in-game.

### rights

The rights a player with this rank has in the guild. The calculation of multiple rights is a bit different in this case as the rights do not all have 2^n values. To combine ranks, you must do the OR operation (\|) on the two flags.

| Flag    | Name                        | Comments                                                                  |
