#### id

Unique ID for each path.

*The TDB standard way of assigning an ID is to multiply GUID of the creature by 10.*

*So for a creature with a GUID of 1234 the path ID would be 12340. Any waypoints submitted to TDB should follow this standard.*

*However, this is only a suggestion when creating your own waypoints. This ID can be anything you want as long as creature\_addon.path\_id is set to the ID you pick here for the creature you are creating a waypoint for.*

#### point

Unique point ID for each point in a path. Starts at 1 and increases with each path.

#### position\_x

The X coordinate of the destination waypoint.

#### position\_y

The Y coordinate of the destination waypoint.

#### position\_z

The Z coordinate of the destination waypoint.

#### orientation

The orientation of the creature. (North = 0.0; South = Ï€ (3.14159))

#### delay

Time to wait (in ms) between each point.

#### move\_type

|      |     |
|------|-----|
| Walk | 0   |
| Run  | 1   |
| Fly  | 2   |

#### action

ID of the action to be performed. See [waypoint\_scripts.id](scripts#id).

#### action\_chance

Percentage of action happening (0-100%).

#### wpguid

This field is used by the core and is **NOT** to be set by hand.

This field holds the GUID of the waypoint visual when you enable the visual mode for waypoints.
