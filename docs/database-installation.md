## Creating the Database in MySQL

### Creating the Databases and User

First of all, you need to create the acore user. You need to run the script below within a MySQL client or with the MySQL command-line interface (CLI). 
You need to run the script as the **root** user of MySQL within a MySQL client or the MySQL cli.

{% include important.html content="Use the MySQL root user ONLY to run the script above, never run the core as root or administrator!" %}

{% include tip.html content="You can change the password of the user you are creating for increased security." %}

## Populating the database

If you want to know how the SQL directory works or plan to have custom changes we recommend you read [this](sql-directory).

#### Automatic Database Updater

The Auth- and Worldserver checks and applies all needed database files at startup.

To edit the automatic database updater you will find the necessary settings in authserver.conf and worldserver.conf under **UPDATE SETTINGS**.

1. Start Authserver.
2. Start Worldserver.

If you get the following message in your console press enter to create and populate the databases.

```
Database "acore_auth" does not exist
Do you want to create it? [yes (default) / no]:
```
