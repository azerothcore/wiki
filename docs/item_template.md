### GemProperties

### RequiredDisenchantSkill

The required proficiency in disenchanting that the player needs to have to be able to disenchant this item.
If set to -1, the item can't be disenchanted.

### ArmorDamageModifier

`field-no-description|76`

### duration

The duration of the item in seconds ingame time.
Set ITEM\_FLAGS\_CU\_DURATION\_REAL\_TIME in *flagsCustom* for real time. In that case the item duration will tick even if player is offline.

### ItemLimitCategory

This is related to ItemLimitCategory.dbc.
It is a property that defines if an item belongs to a "category", like "Mana Gems" or "Healthstone" and it defines how many items of the category you can have in the bag (this is the "limit").
For example, for Healthstone, there are several items like "Lesser Healthstone, Greater Healthstone, etc." but you can have only one in your bag (check as example value 3 or 4).

### HolidayId

See the [Holidays DBC file](Holidays) for the IDs of all of the holidays.

### ScriptName

The name of the script that the item should use. There is no 'internalitemhandler' or 'internalitemhanler' script so trinity will ignore any such values in this field.

### DisenchantID

The disenchant loot template ID. See [disenchant\_loot\_template.entry](http://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/loot_template#loot_template-Entry)

### FoodType

If this item is a food type item, this field defines what type of food it is for hunters who want to feed their pets. It controls in what diet this food item falls in.

NOTE: Raw meat and fish is not the same as regular meat and fish. It seems that the last two types of diets include grey "poor" types of food that players have no use for but some pets seem to be able to eat. Also, those food types appeared in TBC so most likely only TBC pets will have those types of diets.

| ID | Type     |
|----|----------|
| 1  | Meat     |
| 2  | Fish     |
| 3  | Cheese   |
| 4  | Bread    |
| 5  | Fungus   |
| 6  | Fruit    |
| 7  | Raw Meat |
| 8  | Raw Fish |

### minMoneyLoot

### VerifiedBuild

This field was used to determine whether a template has been verified from WDB files.
- If value is 0 then it has not been parsed yet.
- If value is above 0 then it has been parsed with WDB files from that specific client build.
- If value is -1 then it is just a place holder until proper data are found on WDBs.
