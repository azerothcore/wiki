# How to ask for help

### Need help?

Do you need support with AzerothCore? No worries, we're happy to help you!

Whether you have troubles installing AzerothCore, or you want to ask how-to or generic help questions, **we will help you**.

We just want you to ask for support in the **proper way**. Please read this document before asking any help.

### Why is the "proper way" so important?

If you ask a question directly in the chat, it can get easily lost and you might never be helped unless there is someone online in that specific moment that is able to help you.

If you put your question on StackOverflow it will **stay** there and someone can help you at any moment. You can also link your question in the chat to give it more visibility. Doesn't make sense for you? Just keep reading.

Also, most of the questions asked by users are repetitive. So we need an efficient way to handle all the support requests. We use StackOverflow for support questions and GitHub for bug reports.

Sounds complicated? Not at all! **Just keep reading**.

### Bug reports

A game feature (e.g. spell/quest/talent/etc..) doesn't work as it is supposed to?

Congratulations! You've just found a bug, please search among the [existing issues](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/issues). There is a good chance that someone else has already reported the same bug that you found, in such case we kindly ask to you to "confirm" it by leaving a comment.

Example:

If after searching for an existing issue report, you didn't find any, then you should [open a new issue](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/issues/new).
