**Description of the fields**

#### entry

Creature's unique id.

#### difficulty_entry_x

| name                                                      | entry | difficulty_entry_1 | difficulty_entry_2 | difficulty_entry_3 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| [Anomalus](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=26763/anomalus)     | 26763 | 30529                | 0                    | 0                    |
| [Sindragosa](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=36853/sindragosa) | 36853 | 38265                | 38266                | 38267                |

Anomalus is a 5 man boss located in The Nexus. You can fight him on two types of difficulties (normal dungeon and heroic dungeon). Depending on the type of difficulty, bosses have different statistics like health and damage. In case of Anomalus information from entry 26763 is used when you fight him at normal difficulty and entry 30529 is used when you fight him at heroic difficulty.

Sindragosa, a raid boss encounter located in the Icecrown Citadel can be fought on 4 different difficulties due to the introduction of heroic raid modes in Patch 3.2 (10man normal/heroic, 25man normal/heroic). Depending on the type of difficulty, she must have different statistics. So if you see her in 10man normal raid she will use information from entry 36853, in a 25man normal raid entry 38265 will be used and so on.  This is in stark contrast to raid bosses such as Patchwerk and XT-002 Deconstructor, located in Naxxramas and Ulduar respectively, who only have two different raid modes (10-man 'normal'/25-man 'normal').  Hardmodes within the Ulduar raid do not have their own template, due to game mechanics engaging the harder difficulty during the encounter itself.

Here is a special case with the Alterac Valley battleground. There are 4 level brackets where the NPCs are made easier or harder, depending on your level bracket (Added in WoW patch 3.2.2 when level 80 characters received their own bracket for this battleground and all brackets below level 80 received their own level of difficulty).  The same concept applies to the Isle of Conquest battleground, with only two brackets.  

If you look at the database you will notice a very characteristic pattern which is summarized in table below:

| name             | entry             | difficulty_entry_1 | difficulty_entry_2 | difficulty_entry_3 |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Normal Creature  | Different than 0  | 0                    | 0                    | 0                    |
| Dungeon Creature | Normal Dungeon    | Heroic Dungeon       | 0                    | 0                    |
| Raid Creature    | 10man Normal Raid | 25man Normal Raid    | 10man Heroic Raid    | 25man Heroic Raid    |
| Battleground     | 51- 59            | 60-69                | 70-79                | 80                   |

#### KillCredit1

If this is a kill credit template -- one that is a dummy template that is used when more than one creature can count as a kill in a quest, then this is a link to the first [entry](#entry) of the creature that could be killed to give quest credit.

#### KillCredit2

If this is a kill credit template -- one that is a dummy template that is used when more than one creature can count as a kill in a quest, then this is a link to the second [entry](#entry) of the creature that could be killed to give quest credit. If more than two creatures can be killed and count toward a single objective, an smart or C++ script will be required.

#### modelidx

A random graphical model that the client applies on this creature. Of course if you specify only one modelid and the rest will be equal to 0, model you have set won't be chosen randomly. This is a [creature_model_info.modelid](creature_model_info#modelid)

#### name

#### speed_walk

#### speed_run

#### scale

If non-zero, this field defines the size of how the model of the creature appears ingame. If zero, it will use default model size taken from the DBC.

#### rank

The rank of the creature:

| Rank | Name       | Default Respawn Time Creature.spawntimesecs | Corpse Decay Time Worldserver.conf (Corpse.Decay) | Total Default Respawn spawntimesecs + Corpse.Decay |
|------|------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | Normal     | 5 min                                       | 60 sec                                            | 6 min                                              |
| 1    | Elite      | 5 min                                       | 5 min                                             | 10 min                                             |
| 2    | Rare Elite | 5 min                                       | 5 min                                             | 10 min                                             |
| 3    | Boss       | 5 min                                       | 1 hour                                            | 1 hour, 5 min                                      |
| 4    | Rare       | 5 min                                       | 5 min                                             | 10 min                                             |

**Note 1:** An NPC's rank is mostly visual (which also requires your Cache to be cleared to see changes). Changing this value will not change its health, damage, or loot. However, it will change the respawn time of the creature.

**Note 2:** Respawn times can be modified in two other places: [Creature.spawntimesecs](creature#spawntimesecs) (only for that single GUID of the creature) and in the worldserver.conf file under the "Corpse.Decay" settings (for ALL creatures of the same rank). The default \`spawntimesecs\` for all spawned creatures is 300 seconds (5 minutes). For example, using the ".npc add" command to spawn a "Normal" NPC will give it a default respawn time of 6 minutes (spawntimesecs + Corpse.Decay time). Also, the creature must decay first before it can respawn. For this reason, the Corpse Decay Time of the creature is also it's minimum respawn time, since setting the creature's Creature.spawntimesecs = 0 will remove the Default Respawn Time. In the example above, setting our Normal NPC's spawntimesecs = 0 will mean the creature's respawn time decreases from 6 minutes to 60 seconds.

**Note 3:** If you want the creature to show a skull or "??" in the portrait (often with Bosses), set the [type_flags](#type_flags) to 4.

#### dmgschool

Creature's melee damage school.

| ID | Name                  |

#### RangeAttackTime

This is the base time that determines how long a creature must wait between ranged attacks. This time is in milliseconds.

#### BaseVariance

Non-custom creatures should always leave this at 1.

#### unit_class

This is the creature's class, and it dictates levels of health and mana. Also note that health and mana will change according to [exp](#exp), [HealthModifier](#healthmodifier), and [ManaModifier](#manamodifier). Not setting this value will report a minor warning in the "DB_Errors.log".

| Value | Name           | Power Shown                                            |
|-------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|

| 8     | CLASS_MAGE    | health & mana (less health than paladin but more mana) |

#### unit_flags

Allows the manual application of unit flags to creatures. Again this is a bitmask field and to apply more than one flag, just add the different numbers. Some possible flags are:

| Flag       |            | Name                            | Comments                                                                                                   |

#### MovementType

The creature's default movement type.

| ID | Type                                        		 |
|----|---------------------------------------------------|
| 0  | Idle; stay in one place                     		 |
| 1  | Random movement inside the wander_distance radius |
| 2  | Waypoint movement                           		 |

#### InhabitType

Controls where the creature can move and attack.

| Bitmask | Type   |
|---------|--------|
| 1       | Ground |
| 2       | Water  |
| 4       | Flying |
| 8       | Rooted |

(This is a bitmask. You can add values together: 1+4=5 would make the creature walk on ground and fly.)

**Note:** If your vehicle is a flying vehicle then your accessory **MUST** have it's [InhabitType](#inhabittype) set to (4 - Flying). This being if you set it for both ground and flying it will spawn on the ground if the vehicle is initially spawned on the ground.

#### HoverHeight

Distance above the ground that the creature will hover if it has MOVEMENTFLAG_DISABLE_GRAVITY enabled. Value taken from sniffs.

#### HealthModifier

Used to modify the base Level/Class health of a creature. This field comes from WDB.

#### ManaModifier

Used to modify the base Level/Class mana of a creature. This field comes from WDB.

#### ArmorModifier

Used to modify the base Level/Class armor of a creature.

#### DamageModifier

Used to modify the Minimum/Maximum damage of a creature.

The formulas to calculate the damage output are:

MINDAMAGE = ((([damage_base](creature_classlevelstats#damage_base) + ([attackpower](creature_classlevelstats#attackpower) / 14) * [BaseVariance](#basevariance)) * DamageModifier) * ([BaseAttackTime](#baseattacktime) / 1000))  
MAXDAMAGE = (((([damage_base](creature_classlevelstats#damage_base) * 1.5) + ([attackpower](creature_classlevelstats#attackpower) / 14) * [BaseVariance](creature_template#basevariance)) * DamageModifier) * ([BaseAttackTime](#baseattacktime) / 1000))

damage_base comes from the creature_classlevelstats table and takes its value either from [damage\_base](creature_classlevelstats#damage_base), [damage\_exp1](creature_classlevelstats#damage_exp1) or [damage\_exp2](creature_classlevelstats#damage_exp2) according to the creature's value in [exp](#exp) (0 = base_damage, 1 = damage_exp1, 2 = damage_exp2).

BaseAttackTime is either [BaseAttackTime](#baseattacktime) or [RangeAttackTime](#rangeattacktime) depending on the type of attack.

attackpower is either [attackpower](creature_classlevelstats#attackpower) or [rangedattackpower](creature_classlevelstats#rangedattackpower) depending on the type of attack.

BaseVariance is either [BaseVariance](#basevariance) or [RangeVariance](#rangevariance) depending on the type of attack.


#### ExperienceModifier

TODO!

#### RacialLeader

A flag with two possible values: '1' or '0' indicating whether the creature is a racial leader or not. Killing racial leaders grants 100 honor.

#### ScriptName

The name of the script that this creature uses, if any. This ties a script from a scripting engine to this creature.

#### VerifiedBuild

This field was used to determine whether a template has been verified from WDB files.

If value is 0 then it has not been parsed yet.

If value is above 0 then it has been parsed with WDB files from that specific client build.

If value is -1 then it is just a place holder until proper data are found on WDBs.

If value is -Client Build then it was parsed with WDB files from that specific [client build](http://archive.trinitycore.info/DB:Auth:realmlist#gamebuild "DB:Auth:realmlist") and manually edited later for some special necessity.
