**The \`spell\_learn\_spell\` table**

This table holds information on spells that should be learned at the same time a player learns another spell. For example the few spells that are automatically learned when a player first learns a new profession. All fields in this table use spell IDs from Spell.dbc.

NOTE: Spells with spell effects SPELL\_EFFECT\_LEARN\_SPELL should NOT be included in this table.
