# File Headers

To make the files clean we use a standard format for new file headers.

**Standard header for all files:**

```cpp

**Code cherry-picked from other developers:**

Make sure that the original author is present in the [AUTHORS](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/blob/master/AUTHORS) file, otherwise that author needs to be added here. If the code comes from another organization then you just need to make sure that orgs name exists.
