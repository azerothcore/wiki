**Description of the fields**

### CreatureID

Creature entry from [creature_template.entry](creature_template#entry).

### Index

Value must be within this range. If above or under the SQL will fail on `creature_template_spell_chk_1`.

Index 0 - 7.

Spell position on actionbar for vehicle creatures.

### Spell

Spell ID that can be used for Mind Control of a creature.

### VerifiedBuild

This field was used to determine whether a template has been verified from WDB files.

If value is 0 then it has not been parsed yet.

If value is above 0 then it has been parsed with WDB files from that specific client build.

If value is -1 then it is just a place holder until proper data are found on WDBs.

If value is -Client Build then it was parsed with WDB files from that specific client build and manually edited later for some special necessity.
