# smart\_scripts

[<-Back-to:World](database-world.md)

The `smart_scripts` table has 30 attributes. It serves to make scripts in SQL language. The important thing is always to analyze, who is the event that motivates the execution of an action and of course, who is the objective. As a recommendation, you can review the scripts that are already inside the table, to understand how it works. The advantage, for which several use this method, is that it is not required to compile, when adding records, with restarting the server, if it is well programmed, you can appreciate the changes. Another reason is the portability, but it depends on the point of view of the developer, the response you can get.

**Description of the fields**

### entryorguid

- EntryOrGuid > 0: `entry` of the creature / game object / etc.
- EntryOrGuid < 0: `guid` of the creature / game object / etc.
- **Depends on source\_type.**

### source\_type

Object type: creature, game object, spell. see table below for values

| Name                                   | Value |
|----------------------------------------|-------|
| SMART\_SCRIPT\_TYPE\_CREATURE          | 0     |
| SMART\_SCRIPT\_TYPE\_GAMEOBJECT        | 1     |
| SMART\_SCRIPT\_TYPE\_AREATRIGGER       | 2     |
| SMART\_SCRIPT\_TYPE\_TIMED\_ACTIONLIST | 9     |

### id

Incremental id *bound* to each entryorguid & source\_type (0, 1, 2, ...).

### link

Simple event linking;

- Example: if id = 0 and link = 1; id 1 will only be able to occur if id = 0 was triggered (id 1 has to use event\_type SMART\_EVENT\_LINK).
- Smart\_event to be used.

**Thanks to the use of links, you can execute several actions, keeping the same event.**

### event\_phase\_mask

When dealing with phases, *phase IDs* have to be used. There are 13 (12+1) different phases: 1, 2, ... 12 and the default 0.

**Example:** The script is in phase 0 by default - If we want it to go to phase 1, we got two choices:

- SMART\_ACTION\_INC\_PHASE by 1 or SMART\_ACTION\_SET\_PHASE 1

If the script is in phase 0 and want to skip to phase 2:

- SMART\_ACTION\_INC\_PHASE by 2 or SMART\_ACTION\_SET\_PHASE 2

If the script is in phase 1 and want to skip to phase 2:

- SMART\_ACTION\_INC\_PHASE by 1 or SMART\_ACTION\_SET\_PHASE 2

| Name                             | Flag | Hex   | Comment                     |
|----------------------------------|------|-------|-----------------------------|
| SMART\_EVENT\_PHASE\_ALWAYS\_BIT | 0    | 0x000 | Means all phases (1 ... 12) |
| SMART\_EVENT\_PHASE\_1           | 1    | 0x001 | Phase 1 only.               |
| SMART\_EVENT\_PHASE\_2           | 2    | 0x002 | Phase 2 only.               |
| SMART\_EVENT\_PHASE\_3           | 4    | 0x004 | Phase 3 only.               |
| SMART\_EVENT\_PHASE\_4           | 8    | 0x008 | Phase 4 only.               |
| SMART\_EVENT\_PHASE\_5           | 16   | 0x010 | Phase 5 only.               |
| SMART\_EVENT\_PHASE\_6           | 32   | 0x020 | Phase 6 only.               |
| SMART\_EVENT\_PHASE\_7           | 64   | 0x040 | Phase 7 only.               |
| SMART\_EVENT\_PHASE\_8           | 128  | 0x080 | Phase 8 only.               |
| SMART\_EVENT\_PHASE\_9           | 256  | 0x100 | Phase 9 only.               |
| SMART\_EVENT\_PHASE\_10          | 512  | 0x200 | Phase 10 only.              |
| SMART\_EVENT\_PHASE\_11          | 1024 | 0x400 | Phase 11 only.              |
| SMART\_EVENT\_PHASE\_12          | 2048 | 0x800 | Phase 12 only.              |

- Event will only be able to occur if creature/GO is in this phase.
- Example: If we want an event to only be able to occure in phase 1 and 4, **event\_phase\_mask** = 1+8 = 9

### event\_chance

This is the probability of the event to occur as a percentage from 0-100. So, if you want the event to occur roughly half of the time, then set this to 50. 

### event\_flags

| Name                            | Flag | Hex   | Comment                                        |
|---------------------------------|------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| SMART_EVENT_FLAG_NOT_REPEATABLE | 1    | 0x01  | Event can not repeat                           |
| SMART_EVENT_FLAG_DIFFICULTY_0   | 2    | 0x02  | Event only occurs in normal dungeon            |
| SMART_EVENT_FLAG_DIFFICULTY_1   | 4    | 0x04  | Event only occurs in heroic dungeon            |
| SMART_EVENT_FLAG_DIFFICULTY_2   | 8    | 0x08  | Event only occurs in normal raid               |
| SMART_EVENT_FLAG_DIFFICULTY_3   | 16   | 0x10  | Event only occurs in heroic raid               |
| SMART_EVENT_FLAG_RESERVED_5     | 32   | 0x20  |                                                |
| SMART_EVENT_FLAG_RESERVED_6     | 64   | 0x40  |                                                |
| SMART_EVENT_FLAG_DEBUG_ONLY     | 128  | 0x80  | Event only occurs in debug build               |
| SMART_EVENT_FLAG_DONT_RESET     | 256  | 0x100 | Event will not reset in SmartScript::OnReset() |

- Sets if the event should not repeat or should only happen in a given instance/dungeon difficulty (if applicable);
- Values can be added together (bitwise math).

### comment

Commenting on SAI uses a template which is the following: (with an example)

"Creature name - Event - Action"

"Minion of Gurok - On spawn - Set Random Movement"

**Quick notes:**

- Always update *creature\_template*,*gameobject\_template* or *areatrigger\_scripts* with:

```sql
UPDATE `creature_template` SET `AIName` = 'SmartAI' WHERE `entry` = y;

UPDATE `gameobject_template` SET `AIName` = 'SmartGameObjectAI' WHERE `entry` = y;

INSERT INTO `areatrigger_scripts` (`entry`, `ScriptName`) VALUES (y, 'SmartTrigger');
```

- If the creature or GO is inside a dungeon, set *event\_flags* accordingly to the instance difficulty (heroic, 25 man, etc.).

**In case of doubt about an *Event*, *Action\_or \_Target,\_check source code (\_src/server/game/AI/SmartScripts* files; mainly \*SmartScript.cpp**)
