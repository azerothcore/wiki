Welcome to the AzerothCore Docker guide!

## Introduction

Installing AzerothCore using Docker is a simplified procedure that has several benefits:

- It's very easy! Docker will do all the dirty work for you.
- It can be done in all operating systems where Docker is available (including **Windows**, **GNU/Linux**, **macOS**)
- You don't need to install many dependencies (forget about _visual studio_, _cmake_, _mysql_, etc.. they are **NOT** required)
- Forget about platform-specific bugs. When using Docker, AzerothCore will always run in **Linux-mode**. 
- There are many other [benefits when using Docker](https://www.google.com/search?q=docker+benefits)

#### Memory usage

The total amount of RAM when running all AzerothCore docker containers is **less than 2 GB** with no players online.

This is an example of a fresh, empty AzerothCore server running with Docker on macOS:

When used on GNU/Linux system, the amount of memory used by Docker is even less.

#### Docker containers vs Virtual machines

Usind Docker will have the same benefits as using virtual machines, but with much less overhead:

## Setup

### Software requirements

The only requirements are [git](https://git-scm.com/download/) and Docker.

#### New Operating Systems [recommended]:
- For GNU/Linux install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- For macOS 10.12+ Sierra and newer version install [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)
- For Windows 10 install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)

#### Old Operating Systems [not tested]:
- For macOS older than 10.11 El Capitan and older install [Docker Toolbox for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_mac/)
- For Windows 7/8/8.1 install [Docker Toolbox for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)


Before going further, make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed in your system by typing in a terminal:

```
docker --version
```
```
docker-compose --version
```

You should see a similar output:

**Note for Windows users**: you can use **git-bash** (the shell included in git) as a terminal.

### Clone the AzerothCore repository

You need to clone the AzerothCore repository (or use your own fork):

```
git clone https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk.git
```

Now cd into the main directory using `cd azerothcore-wotlk`. **All commands will have to be run from this position**.

### WoW Client Data files

You also need to have the data files. Check the step "5) Download the data files" from the [installation guide](Installation#5-download-the-data-files).

Put your data files into the `docker/worldserver/data/` folder that is inside `azerothcore-wotlk`.

### Installation

Inside your terminal (if you use Windows, use git bash), run the following commands.

**1) Generate your server configuration files:**

```
./bin/acore-docker-generate-etc
```

**2) Compile AzerothCore:**
```
./bin/acore-docker-build
```
This will take a while. Meanwhile you can go and drink a glass of wine :wine_glass:

**3) Run the containers**
```
docker-compose up
```

Docker will build and run your containers. Meanwhile you will see messages like:

> Could not connect to MySQL database at 127.0.0.1: Can't connect to MySQL server on '127.0.0.1' (111)

> Retrying in 10 seconds...

**Don't panic**. Your server processes are simply waiting for the database container to be ready, it can take a while (depends on your machine).

Your server will be up and running shortly. 
To access your MySQL database we recommend clients like [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/) (for Windows/Linux+Wine) or [SequelPro](https://www.sequelpro.com/) (for macOS). Use `root` as user and `127.0.0.1` as default host.
The default password of the root DB user will be `password`.

#### Docker reference & support requests

For server administrators, we recommend to read the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) as well as the [Docker Compose reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/).

If you want to be an administrator of an AzerothCore production server, it helps if you master the basics of Docker usage.

## FAQ
*Faq? Faq you!*

### Where are the etc and logs folders of my server?

By default they are located in `docker/authserver/` and `docker/worldserver/`.

### How can I change the docker containers configuration?

You can copy the file `.env.dist`, renaming the copy in `.env` and editing it accordingly to your needs.

In the `.env` file you can configure:

- the location of the `data`, `etc` and `logs` folders
- the open ports
- the MySQL root password

Then your `docker-compose up` will automatically locate the `.env` with your custom settings.

### How can I start, stop, create and destroy my containers?

- The `docker-compose start` will start your existing containers.

- The `docker-compose stop` will stop your containers, but it wonâ€™t remove them.

- The `docker-compose up` builds, (re)creates, and starts your containers.

- The `docker-compose down` command will stop your containers, but it also removes the stopped containers as well as any networks that were created.

### How can I delete my database files?

**Warning** Once you've deleted your database files they are unrecoverable unless you have a backup.

To remove your database files you firstly want to make sure that your containers have been stopped and removed by typing: `docker-compose down`.

After stopping and removing your containers you can proceed to remove the volume by typing: `docker volume rm azerothcore-wotlk_ac-database`

**Note** If you've changed your folder name from the default `azerothcore-wotlk` the volume name will be slightly different. To find the new volume name you can use the command `docker volume ls`. The volume should be labelled something along the lines of `xxxx_ac-database`.

### How can I run commands in the worldserver console?

You can easily attach/detach from the worldserver console.
First of all, type `docker-compose ps` to know the name of your worldserver container, it should be something like `azerothcore-wotlk_ac-worldserver_1`.

**To attach**: open a new terminal tab and type `docker attach azerothcore-wotlk_ac-worldserver_1`

Note for Windows users: using git bash on Windows you have to prefix this command with `winpty`. Example:

`winpty docker attach azerothcore-wotlk_ac-worldserver_1`

**To detach**: press `ctr+p` and `ctrl+q`.

Do **NOT** try to detach using `ctrl+c` or you will kill your worldserver process!
