Welcome to the AzerothCore Docker guide!

## Introduction

Installing AzerothCore using Docker is a simplified procedure that has several benefits:

- It's very easy! Docker will do all the dirty work for you.
- It can be done in all operating systems where Docker is available (including **Windows**, **GNU/Linux**, **macOS**)
- You don't need to install many dependencies (forget about _visual studio_, _cmake_, _mysql_, etc.. they are **NOT** required)
- Forget about platform-specific bugs. When using Docker, AzerothCore will always run in **Linux-mode**. 
- There are many other [benefits when using Docker](https://www.google.com/search?q=docker+benefits)

## Setup

### Software requirements

The only requirements are [git](https://git-scm.com/download/) and Docker.

#### New Operating Systems [recommended]:
- For GNU/Linux install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- For macOS 10.12+ Sierra and newer version install [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)
- For Windows 10 install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)

#### Old Operating Systems [not tested]:
- For macOS older than 10.11 El Capitan and older install [Docker Toolbox for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_mac/)
- For Windows 7/8/8.1 install [Docker Toolbox for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)


Before going further, make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed in your system by typing in a terminal:

```
docker --version
```
```
docker-compose --version
```

You should see a similar output:

**Note for Windows users**: you can use **git-bash** (the shell included in git) as a terminal.

### Clone the AzerothCore repository

You need to clone the AzerothCore repository (or use your own fork):

```
git clone https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk.git
```

Now go into the main directory using `cd azerothcore-wotlk`. **All commands will have to be run inside this folder**.

### Installation

Inside your terminal (if you use Windows, use git bash), run the following commands inside the azerothcore-wotlk folder

NOTE: the following procedure uses our acore.sh dashboard, however, these commands are a shortcut of the docker-compose ones.
      you can check the docker-compose commands used in background by running `./acore.sh docker --help` and read the description of each command

**1) Download the client data:**

```
./acore.sh docker client-data
```

NOTE: This command should be executed only at the first installation and when there's a new version of the client-data available

**2) Compile AzerothCore:**
```
./acore.sh docker build
```
This will take a while. Meanwhile you can go and drink a glass of wine :wine_glass:

**3) Run the containers**

```
./acore.sh docker start:app
```

**Congratulations! Now you have an up and running azerothcore server! Continue to the next step to create an account**

If you need to run this in background, you can use the following command to run the docker-compose detached mode:

```
./acore.sh docker start:app:d
```

**4) Access the worldserver console**

Open a new terminal and run the following command

```
./acore.sh docker attach ac-worlserver
```

This command will automatically attach your terminal to the worlserver console. 
Now you can run the `account create <user> <password>` command to create your first in-game account.

**5) Access database and update realmlist**

To access your MySQL database we recommend clients like [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/) (for Windows/Linux+Wine) or [SequelPro](https://www.sequelpro.com/) (for macOS). Use `root` as user and `127.0.0.1` as default host.
The default password of the root DB user will be `password`.

Unless your server installation is on the same network as your client, you might want to update the `realmlist` address in the `acore_auth` database with your server public IP address :
```sql
USE acore_auth;
SELECT * FROM realmlist;
UPDATE realmlist SET address='<SERVER PUBLIC IP ADDRESS>';
```

### How to run the worlserver with GDB

1. Create a `config.sh` file under the `/conf/` directory of the azerothcore-wotlk repository
2. Add this configuration inside: `AC_RESTARTER_WITHGDB=true`. It will configure the restarter used by our docker services to use GDB instead of the binaries directly

### How to use the dev-container

Within our docker-compose you can find the `ac-dev-server` service
This service is used for our build and db operations, but it can also be used
by you to develop with the [VSCode Remote Docker extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)

A dev-container lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment. The **.devcontainer** folder in our project contains files to tell VS Code how to access (or create) a development container with all the needed tools. This container will run the AzerothCore with all the software and the configurations needed for working with our codebase and debugging the server.

Inside the azerothcore repo there's a pre-configured `devcontainer.json` that can be opened by using the VSCode command palette.
To setup the Dev-Container follow these steps:

1. Copy the `docker-compose.override.yml` file from the /conf/dist folder to the root directory of the azerothcore repo. (needed until [this](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/1080) will be solved)
2. [install and open VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. install the remote-container extension
4. Open the azerothcore folder inside VSCode
5. Open the VSCode [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run: `>Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` 

**IMPORTANT**: The dev-container also contains a pre-configured debugger action that allows you to use breakpoints and debug your worlserver. 

Do not forget that you need to [Remote Container extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) 
installed in your [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE

### How to create a second realm with docker-compose

To create a second realm we suggest you to take a look at the example available within the http://github.com/azerothcore/acore-docker repository.

## More info

### Memory usage

The total amount of RAM when running all AzerothCore docker containers is **less than 2 GB** with no players online.

This is an example of a fresh, empty AzerothCore server running with Docker on macOS:

When used on GNU/Linux system, the amount of memory used by Docker is even less.

### Docker containers vs Virtual machines

Using Docker will have the same benefits as using virtual machines, but with much less overhead:

### Docker reference & support requests

For server administrators, we recommend to read the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) as well as the [Docker Compose reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/).

If you want to be an administrator of an AzerothCore production server, it helps if you master the basics of Docker usage.

Feel free to ask questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and link them in the **#support-docker** channel of our [Discord chat](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azerothcore). We will be happy to help you!

## FAQ

### Where are the etc and logs folders of my server?

By default they are located in `env/docker/authserver/` and `env/docker/worldserver/`.

### How can I change the docker containers configuration?

You can copy the file `/conf/dist/.env.docker` to `.env` and place it in the root folder of the project, then edit it according to your needs.

In the `.env` file you can configure:

- the location of the `data`, `etc` and `logs` folders
- the open ports
- the MySQL root password

Then your `docker-compose up` will automatically locate the `.env` with your custom settings.

### How can I start, stop, create and destroy my containers?

- The `docker-compose start` will start your existing containers.

- The `docker-compose stop` will stop your containers, but it won't remove them.

- The `docker-compose up` builds, (re)creates, and starts your containers.

- The `docker-compose down` command will stop your containers, but it also removes the stopped containers as well as any networks that were created.

### How can I delete my database files?

**Warning** Once you've deleted your database files they are unrecoverable unless you have a backup.

To remove your database files you firstly want to make sure that your containers have been stopped and removed by typing: `docker-compose down`.

After stopping and removing your containers you can proceed to remove the volume by typing: `docker volume rm azerothcore-wotlk_ac-database`

**Note** If you've changed your folder name from the default `azerothcore-wotlk` the volume name will be slightly different. To find the new volume name you can use the command `docker volume ls`. The volume should be labelled something along the lines of `xxxx_ac-database`.

### macOS optimizations

The **osxfs** is well known to have [performance limitations](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1592), that's why we optimized the docker-compose 
file for the **osxfs** by using volumes and the "delegated" strategy. However, we also introduced an experimental feature to let you use named volumes instead of binded ones.
You can use this feature by setting this environment variable in your `.env` file:

`DOCKER_EXTENDS_BIND=abstract-no-bind`

This will copy all the external sources in a persistent volume inside docker which means that, as a drawback, changes inside 
the container won't be reflected outside (host) and vice-versa. 

NOTE: If you are not experimenting any particular issues with I/O performance, we suggest to **NOT** use this configuration

### How can I run commands in the worldserver console?

Besides the usage of the `./acore.sh docker attach` command, you can use a manual approach if you encountered any problems.

First of all, type `docker-compose ps` to know the name of your worldserver container, it should be something like `azerothcore-wotlk_ac-worldserver_1`.

**To attach**: open a new terminal tab and type `docker attach azerothcore-wotlk_ac-worldserver_1`

Note for Windows users: using git bash on Windows you have to prefix this command with `winpty`. Example:

`winpty docker attach azerothcore-wotlk_ac-worldserver_1`

**To detach**: press `ctr+p` and `ctrl+q`.

Do **NOT** try to detach using `ctrl+c` or you will kill your worldserver process!
