**Description of the fields**

### CreatureID

[creature_template.entry](creature_template#entry)

### Idx

Index 0-3.

### CreatureDisplayID

DisplayID from CreatureDisplayInfo.dbc.

### DisplayScale

Modifies the model scale.

### Probability

0-1

If it exceeds or fall short of 1 the core will correct it during startup to equal 1.

### VerifiedBuild

This field was used to determine whether a template has been verified from WDB files.

If value is 0 then it has not been parsed yet.

If value is above 0 then it has been parsed with WDB files from that specific client build.

If value is -1 then it is just a place holder until proper data are found on WDBs.

If value is [client build](realmlist#gamebuild) then it was parsed with WDB files from that specific client build and manually edited later for some special necessity.
