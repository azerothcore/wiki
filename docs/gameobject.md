**Description of the fields**

### guid

The global unique identifier for the game object. This field must be unique among all game objects.

### id

The template ID of the gameobject. See [gameobject\_template.entry](http://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/gameobject_template#entry)

### map

The map ID where this object is spawned. See Maps.dbc

### zoneId

The ID of the zone that this object is spawned in. (e.g. The Barrens)

This column is filled in by the worldserver on startup if the `Calculate.Gameoject.Zone.Area.Data` setting is enabled. It originates from AreaTable.dbc.

### areaId

The ID of the area that this object is spawned in. You can think of an area as a "subzone" of a zone, e.g. Lushwater Oasis inside The Barrens. 

This column is filled in by the worldserver on startup if the `Calculate.Gameoject.Zone.Area.Data` setting is enabled. It originates from AreaTable.dbc.

### spawnMask

Controls under which difficulties the object is spawned.

Just like flags you can add them as you wish so 3 would be: Spawned in 10/25 man normal versions of maps (pre 3.2 all maps)

| Value | Comment                                                                              |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Not spawned                                                                          |
| 1     | Spawned only in 10-man-normal versions of maps (includes maps without a heroic mode) |
| 2     | Spawned only in 25-man-normal versions of maps (or heroics pre 3.2)                  |
| 4     | Spawned only in 10-man heroic versions of maps                                       |
| 8     | Spawned only in 25-man-heroic versions of maps                                       |
| 15    | Spawned in all versions of maps                                                      |

### phaseMask

This is a bitmask field that describes all the phases that this gameobject will appear in. Aura 261 determines the phase you can see. For example, if you had this aura <http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55782>, you would be able to see gameobjects in phase 2. If you wanted the gameobject to be visible in both phase 1 and phase 2, you would set the phaseMask to 3.

### position\_x

The X position.

### position\_y

The Y position.

### position\_z

The Z position.

### orientation

The orientation. (North = 0, South = 3.14159)

### rotation0

### rotation1

### rotation2

### rotation3

### spawntimesecs

Time in seconds for this object to respawn.

Using a negative value will result in the object starting out by being "despawned" until a script will spawn it. It will then despawn after the amount of time specified here has passed.

### animprogress

Not really known what this is used for at this time. However, always set it to 100 for chests.

### state

For chests or doors.

-   1 = closed
-   0 = open
