## Starting the server

- Run authserver and worldserver in your build folder.

For detailed information on how to configure a restarter and a debugger go to [how-to-restart-and-debug](how-to-restart-and-debug.md) page

**NEVER create an account directly into your database unless you are ABSOLUTELY SURE that you know what to do and how to do it!**

- Next create your Login Account by typing directly into the **worldserver** window the GM Command **account create**. Syntax: (see examples below)

- If you wish to set the account as a GM then type into the worldserver window: **account set gmlevel $account #level #realmid** where **$account** is the account name to change, **#level** can be 0-4 and **#realmid** is the realm ID. Setting a **#level** of "3" is GM account level (higher numbers = more access), and the "-1" is the realm ID that stands for "all realms".

*Tip: Open your **acore_world** database and find the **command** table. This shows a full list of GM Commands, descriptions and security level.*
*This will always be the most up-to-date list you can find, assuming you keep your DB and Core updated.*

- Minimize your servers and run **WoW** (never run WoW using the Launcher unless you edited the realmlist.wtf's patchlist option above).

- Log in using the user/pass you just created.

- The AzerothCore realm should be selectable. Log in, create a character, and you're all done!

## Creating an Account

Read [creating accounts](creating-accounts.md).

## Setting up Remote Access
For development purposes, this step is not necessary. However, for increased security when you want other people to make accounts you should set up a registration form, so you don't have to paste their passwords. Check out [Remote Access](remote-access.md) on how to send commands into the server.
