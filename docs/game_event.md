### end\_time

Absolute end date of the event. The event will stop occurring if the local time at the server is after the one set here.

### occurrence

Number of minutes between 2 occurrences of the event. (2880 = 2 days, 1440 = 1 day, etc)

### length

Number of minutes the event will last after the start of the occurrence. (2880 = 2 days, 1440 = 1 day, etc)
This value must be lower than occurrence one or the event will never stop.
