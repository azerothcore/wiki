# IP2LOCATION

With IP2LOCATION we can approximately see which country a player might be coming from using the `.pinfo <player>` command.

To be able to use this system you have to provide the **ip2location lite database** to your Authserver.

Download **IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB1.CSV** from https://download.ip2location.com/lite/

Unzip the file and place it in the directory of your choice.

In authserver.conf and worldserver.conf you need to set the full directory path including the .CSV under IPLocationFile.

On the Auth- and Worldserver start you will be able to see the .CSV file being loaded in the log.
