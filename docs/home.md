## Overview

AzerothCore is a complete Open Source and Modular solution for MMO

### Solid base

AzerothCore has a strong and solid base, coming from years of development: it is based on MaNGOS, TrinityCore and SunwellCore.
We're improving this reliability offering a project that follow specific versioning rules, allowing you to develop in the right way. Read More...

### Playable
Our main goal is to provide a fully working and playable server application. We will focus our stable revisions on final user experiences, instead of following strict development patterns like our predecessors.
Of course we will work to improve the code in every new versions that are under development stage.

### Open Source
AzerothCore modules are released under GNU AGPL 3.0 and GNU GPL 2.0, both those liceses are totally free and open source. We believe in the free software, we love cooperation.

### Tested, realiable, updated
SunwellCore, the father of AzerothCore, had been running with thousands of players for years. The goal of AzerothCore is to keep this game application updated, continuing its development.

### Community-driven
The main strenght of AzerothCore is its community. Users can help us by improving our code base or simply by submitting any bug report. If you want to contribute, we'd love it!

### Modular
We try to make our software as modular as possible, because modular software is much easier to be extended.
