## IMPORTANT NOTE

**OpenSSL 3.x is NOT SUPPORTED. Use the version the installation guide points to.**

**Ubuntu 22.0 and later ships with OpenSSL 3.x! If you want to use Ubuntu, use a lower version or compile a lower version of OpenSSL**

**The AzerothCore Team and Owners DO NOT in any case sponsor nor support illegal public servers. If you use these projects to run an illegal public server and not for testing and learning it is your own personal choice.**

## Overview

AzerothCore is a complete Open Source and Modular solution for MMO development.

### Solid base

AzerothCore has a strong and solid base, coming from years of development. It is based on MaNGOS, TrinityCore and SunwellCore.
We're improving this reliability, offering a project that follows specific versioning rules, allowing you to develop in the right way. Read More...

### Playable
Our main goal is to provide a fully working and playable server application. We will focus our stable revisions on final user experiences, instead of following strict development patterns like our predecessors.
Of course we will work to improve the code in every new version that is under development.

### Open Source
AzerothCore modules are released under GNU AGPL 3.0 and GNU GPL 2.0. Both of these licenses are totally free and open source. We believe in the free software, and we love cooperation.

### Tested, reliable, updated
SunwellCore, the father of AzerothCore, successfully ran with thousands of players for years. The goal of AzerothCore is to keep this game application updated, continuing its development.

### Community-driven
The main strength of AzerothCore is its community. Users can help us by improving our code base or simply by submitting any bug report. If you want to contribute, we'd love it!

### Modular
We try to make our software as modular as possible, because modular software is much easier to extend.
