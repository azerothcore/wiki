# Installation Guide

## Introduction

There are several ways to install AzerothCore, you need to choose ONE.

[AzerothCore Bash Dashboard setup](ac-dashboard-core-installation.md) (simplest way of installing AzerothCore, recommended for **Linux** systems for both local development and production. Currently not recommended for Windows or macOS.)

[Docker setup](Install-with-Docker.md) (a simplified installation process based on Docker.)

[Amazon Web Services](aws-tutorial.md)

[Digital Ocean droplet](digital-ocean-video-tutorial.md)

[ArchLinux](arch-linux.md)

Classic installation guides for Linux, macOS and Windows can be found in our Installation Guide series below.

Every step of the guide is divided in three tabs regarding different operating systems (Linux, macOS and Windows).

The guide has been divided into 8 steps, to make it more readable:

1. [Requirements](requirements.md)

1. [Core Installation](core-installation.md)

1. [Server Setup](server-setup.md)

1. [Database Installation](database-installation.md)

1. [Networking](networking.md)

1. [Final Server Steps](final-server-steps.md)

1. [Keeping the Server Up-to-Date](keeping-the-server-up-to-date.md)

1. [Client Setup](client-setup.md)

Each step can be read independently or you can read them neatly, to gradually get into it and better understand it all.

*Tip: If this is your first time installing AzerothCore we recommend that you read every step carefully!*
