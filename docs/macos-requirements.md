| :- |
| MySQL ≥ 5.7.0 |
| CMake ≥ 3.16 |


- Install XCode using the App Store, then open the terminal and type:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

- Install the package manager [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

Use brew it to install the required packages:

```sh
brew update
```

```sh
brew install openssl readline cmake ace coreutils bash bash-completion coreutils
```

This will install bash 5+, you might need to restart your terminal.
Make sure you are using bash 5 or newer by typing `bash --version`.

Now install mysql:

```sh
brew install mysql
```

You will be prompted some instructions to complete the `mysql` installation, for example to properly set a password. Just follow the instructions and properly configure mysql. **This step is important, do not skip it.**

To verify that mysql has been properly installed, try accessing it using either the command line (e.g. `mysql -u root -p`) or using DB client managers with a UI like Sequel Ace.

You can install Sequel Ace with:

```sh
brew cask install sequel-ace
```
