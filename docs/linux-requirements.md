| |
| :- |
| MySQL ≥ 5.7.0 |
| Boost ≥ 1.74 |
| OpenSSL ≥ 1.0.x (OpenSSL 3.0 is not supported) |
| CMake ≥ 3.16 |
| Clang ≥ [10](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/actions?query=workflow%3Acore-build) |

#### IMPORTANT NOTE

**OpenSSL 3.x is NOT SUPPORTED. Use the version the installation guide points to.**

**Ubuntu 22.0 and later ships with OpenSSL 3.x! If you want to use Ubuntu, use a lower version or compile a lower version of OpenSSL**

#### Ubuntu with MariaDB 10.x

AzerothCore does only support MariaDB versions 10.6 and 10.5.

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y && sudo apt install git cmake make gcc g++ clang libssl-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libncurses-dev libboost-all-dev mariadb-server mariadb-client libmariadb-dev libmariadb-dev-compat
```

#### Ubuntu with MySQL 8.x

```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git cmake make gcc g++ clang libmysqlclient-dev libssl-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libncurses-dev mysql-server libboost-all-dev
```

Remember that if you are using the `root` user, it is not necessary to use `sudo`.

To configure MySQL in Ubuntu 18.04 and similar (set `root` password and other settings) read [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-18-04).

**Note**: in older versions of Ubuntu like **18.04** you need to install `gcc-10` and `libboost1.74-dev`:

```
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:mhier/libboost-latest
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install -y gcc-10 g++-10
sudo apt install -y install libboost1.74-dev
```

--- 

#### Debian 10

```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git cmake make gcc g++ clang default-libmysqlclient-dev libssl-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libncurses-dev mariadb-server libboost-all-dev
```

Remember that if you are using the `root` user, it is not necessary to use `sudo`.

**Note:** If you add the option `-y` and at the end of the list, it will start installing them without the need for you to confirm.

**Example:**

```sh
apt-get update && apt-get install git cmake make gcc g++ clang default-libmysqlclient-dev libssl-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libncurses-dev mariadb-server libboost-all-dev -y
```

#### Check your clang version

```sh
clang --version
```

Your `clang` version **MUST** be `10` or higher ([here](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/actions?query=workflow%3Acore-build) you can check the versions that run in our Github Actions pipeline, we recommend to use one of those versions).

For example, if you are using an older version of Ubuntu like 18.04, you need to install clang using:

```sh
sudo apt-get install clang-10.0
```

If you use another distro or version, search on google for how to install the right clang version for your system.

Currently the project requires clang10 or higher.

This is a way to upgrade and install version 11.

The answer is detailed here:

[How to install clang 11 on Debian](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66223241/how-to-install-clang-11-on-debian)

#### Check your cmake version

```sh
cmake --version
```

Your `cmake` version **MUST** be `3.16` or higher.

On an older version of Ubuntu (example: 16.04), you can follow the instructions here in order to install the latest cmake version. On debian you would need to use the backports sources or build Cmake manually.

Remember that it is possible to update cmake, using Python.

Install:

```sh
python -m pip install cmake
```

Update:

```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade cmake
```

#### Ensure that the gcc-8 headers are installed

This is an issue if for example using an older version of Ubuntu like 16.04. There you have to add the PPA "Toolchain test builds":
https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-toolchain-r/+archive/ubuntu/test

After

```sh
sudo apt-get update
```

you can install gcc-8: 

```sh
sudo apt-get install g++-8 gcc-8
```
